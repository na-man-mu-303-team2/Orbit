# ECS single-AZ cutover runbook

## Scope and safety boundary

- ALB requires public subnets in two AZs. Only the public ALB subnet is multi-AZ; NAT, ECS tasks, Redis nodes, and RDS compute stay in `ap-northeast-2a`.
- The existing EC2 path, local Redis volume, CloudFront distribution, and legacy target group stay intact for seven days after ECS reaches 100%.
- No runbook step prints a secret, cookie, Redis value, raw audio, or transcript. Confirm only secret existence and configuration references.
- `infra/aws/main-production-bootstrap.yaml` continues to own the existing EC2/RDS/CloudFront resources. Do not import, replace, or delete them in the new stacks.

## Pre-change readiness gate

- Do not create or execute a Change Set with an AWS account root session. Configure separate least-privilege GitHub OIDC roles in repository variable `AWS_INFRA_PLAN_ROLE_ARN` and production environment variable `AWS_INFRA_APPLY_ROLE_ARN`; the apply role remains behind the `production` environment approval.
- Configure repository variable `AWS_CLOUDFORMATION_EXECUTION_ROLE_ARN` with a dedicated role trusted only by `cloudformation.amazonaws.com`. The Plan workflow must pass this role with `create-change-set --role-arn`. `DescribeChangeSet` does not return the role ARN, so the role boundary is enforced at Change Set creation through the Plan role's exact `iam:PassRole` scope, not by parsing the review artifact. Do not define an environment-level variable with the same name.
- Keep GitHub roles and the CloudFormation execution role separate. The Plan role receives only its required CloudFormation control-plane actions and `iam:PassRole` scoped to the exact execution role with `iam:PassedToService=cloudformation.amazonaws.com`. The Apply role receives only the actions needed to describe and execute the reviewed Change Set and observe completion; resource provisioning permissions belong only to the execution role.
- Configure repository variable `AWS_ECR_PUBLISH_ROLE_ARN` as a separate main-branch image publishing role. It must not reuse the Plan, Apply, or CloudFormation execution role.
- Confirm `origin.tryorbit.site` has an issued ACM certificate in `ap-northeast-2`. The existing CloudFront certificate in `us-east-1` cannot terminate the regional ALB listener.
- Confirm the Route 53 public hosted zone and the regional `com.amazonaws.global.cloudfront.origin-facing` managed prefix list exist. Pass the hosted zone ID and prefix-list ID as identifiers; never put DNS or verification secret values in workflow inputs.
- Before the shared-services Change Set, create the queue Redis and private-evidence Redis AUTH secrets. Before the compute Change Set, create the origin-verification secret and a customer-managed-KMS-encrypted application runtime secret. Check only resource existence and required JSON key names; never print values.
- Confirm the existing private-audio bucket ARN, runtime policy ARN, `raw/` 14-day lifecycle, `evidence/` 7-day lifecycle, and public-access block. ECR repositories and managed Redis are expected additions in the shared-services Change Set.
- Verify `PublicSubnetBCidr` and `PrivateAppSubnetACidr` do not overlap existing VPC subnets, then validate all three templates with CloudFormation before opening a Change Set.
- Record the retained bootstrap stack's `Ec2SecurityGroupId` and `RdsSecurityGroupId` outputs. Pass them to the compute stack as `LegacyEc2SecurityGroupId` and `RdsSecurityGroupId`; the compute stack owns only the additive ALB-to-EC2 port 80 and ECS-to-RDS port 5432 ingress rules.

## Required approval evidence

1. Record the current application SHA, RDS manual snapshot ID, CloudFront distribution configuration export, and current stack template in the production change record.
2. Run `Plan AWS infrastructure`; record the successful workflow run and use only the Change Set ARN produced by that run. Confirm the change set contains no replacement or deletion of `AWS::RDS::DBInstance`, `AWS::S3::Bucket`, `AWS::CloudFront::Distribution`, or `AWS::EC2::Instance`.
   A protected `Modify` is safe only when CloudFormation reports `Replacement: False`; `True`, `Conditional`, and missing replacement evidence are blocked.
3. Apply a reviewed change set only through `Apply AWS infrastructure`, protected by GitHub environment `production` approval.
4. Deploy `edge-waf-count-mode.yaml` in `us-east-1`, retain Count mode for at least 24 hours, and verify that WAF logging redacts `cookie`, `authorization`, and the origin verification header before a separate Block-mode PR.

## Build and candidate verification

1. Let `Build and push images` copy the exact `main` SHA manifest to ECR and record immutable `@sha256` digests. Supply only those digests to the ECS compute change set.
2. Create the shared-services stack additively: private app subnet A, NAT, S3 gateway endpoint, two TLS Redis nodes, and ECR repositories. Pass the retained production storage stack's private-audio bucket ARN and runtime policy ARN; this stack must not create or replace that bucket.
3. Keep `S3_PRIVATE_AUDIO_BUCKET` empty on EC2 and set it only on ECS tasks after the existing policy is attached. New raw audio keys start with `raw/`, evidence derivatives start with `evidence/`, and prefixless legacy audio remains readable from the assets bucket. Verify the existing 14-day raw and 7-day evidence lifecycle rules before traffic shift.
4. Treat the existing bucket's SSE-S3 encryption as current state. SSE-KMS hardening requires a separate reviewed update to the storage-owning stack; do not silently replace or import the bucket during this cutover.
5. Deploy the ECS compute stack with ALB weights EC2 `100`, ECS `0`. Confirm the stack created the ECS-client-to-RDS and ALB-to-legacy-EC2 ingress rules, and that API runtime config reports slide practice and slide question guides enabled. Use a candidate CloudFront distribution for login, Deck save, OOXML sync, export, AI deck, rehearsal audio, legacy audio read, Socket.IO presence, and AI/STT/OCR job smoke tests.
6. In the retained bootstrap stack Change Set, set `ApplicationOriginDomainName` only after the ALB candidate is healthy. The API, auth, and Socket.IO behaviors then use CloudFront `AllViewerExceptHostHeader`, so the origin receives `origin.tryorbit.site` while existing direct-EC2 operation keeps `AllViewer`.
7. Run migrations as one one-off ECS API task from the immutable API digest. Never run migrations from API service startup. During the seven-day rollback window, permit expand-only schema changes; do not automate migration revert.

## Worker handoff and traffic ramp

1. Set `ASYNC_JOB_ADMISSION_MODE=drain` through the approved runtime secret update.
2. Confirm queue and database active counts are zero using read-only operational queries; do not dump values into logs.
3. Replace the ECS Worker task, then resume admission with `accept`. Keep the EC2 Worker in standby until the ECS worker completes smoke verification.
4. Update ALB weights in the reviewed change set: ECS `5%` for 15 minutes, `25%` for 30 minutes, `50%` for 60 minutes, then `100%` for 24 hours. Target-group and target stickiness remain enabled throughout Socket.IO polling.
5. At every stage inspect ALB 5xx, API p95, healthy target count, Job failure/delay, Redis eviction, RDS connections, Socket.IO presence, private audio reads, and legacy audio fallback.

## Abort and rollback

Immediately return ALB weight to EC2 `100` when any of these holds: ALB 5xx is at least 2% for five minutes, ECS healthy target count is zero, new Job failures materially spike, or Redis eviction is observed.

1. ALB rollback: update only target group weights to EC2 `100`, ECS `0`.
2. Worker rollback: drain admission, stop ECS Worker, re-enable EC2 Worker, then resume admission.
3. ALB outage: execute the pre-reviewed CloudFront origin rollback change set to point directly to EC2.
4. Managed Redis outage: only after stopping API writes, copy key/TTL state back to the retained local Redis. Do not delete managed Redis as a recovery action.
5. WAF false positive: detach the WebACL or move the affected rule back to Count mode.

Do not roll back application code before the PR #640 runtime fixes: the safe rollback floor is the fixed version that understands private-audio routing. After seven clean days, remove EC2, local Redis, candidate distribution, and legacy target resources only in a separately approved PR.
